# Project Overview
Build a simple task tracking application inspired by Trello. Users should be able to create, edit, delete, assign, and manage tasks across three stages: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
## Core Features
### User Management
- User Registration & Login (using Firebase Authentication)
- User Roles: All users can create and assign tasks
- Store user info in Firebase Firestore
### Task Management
- Create a new task with Title, Description, and Assigned To
- Edit and delete tasks
- Task Status: To Do | In Progress | Done
### Task Movement
- Move tasks using buttons (Move to In Progress, Move to Done)
- Drag and Drop functionality using a library like `react-beautiful-dnd`
### Task Board UI
- Display tasks in a 3-column layout: To Do, In Progress, Done
- Each column shows tasks by status
- Use cards with minimal styling (title + assigned user)
### Sample UI Layout:
Tech Stack Guidelines
- Frontend: React, React Router
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Drag & Drop: react-beautiful-dnd or similar
### Bonus Features (if time permits)
- Search/filter tasks by title or assigned user
- Due date and task priority
- Activity log (who moved which task and when)
- User profile page showing assigned tasks
### Time Limit
Focus on completing the basic working model first, then add bonus features if time allows.
